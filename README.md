# ğŸŒˆ Rainbow 

Rainbow Programming Language

## WIP

Currently only lexer and parser are implemented. In the near future here can appear the intepreter ğŸ‘€

## Syntax example

```
var fib = fn(x) {
  if (!x)
    return 0;

  if (x < 3)
    return 1;

  return fib(x-1) + fib(x-2);
}

var result = fib(10);
print("The 10th number in Fibonacci sequence is " + result);
```

## REPL

You can play with rainbow by runing `$ go run main.go` and see how your entered statements are parsed in real time
